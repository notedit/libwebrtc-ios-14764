                       The WebRTC native APIs are implemented based on the following [WebRTC spec.](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html) 

                       The code that implements WebRTC native APIs (including the Stream and the PeerConnection APIs) are available in [libjingle](https://code.google.com/p/libjingle/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftalk%2Fapp%2Fwebrtc). A [sample client application](https://code.google.com/p/libjingle/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftalk%2Fexamples%2Fpeerconnection%2Fclient) is also provided there. 

                       The target audience of this document are those who want to use WebRTC Native APIs to develop native RTC applications.
